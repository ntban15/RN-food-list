# RNFoodList

This is my first complete React Native app. It allows user to search for recipes and see details of each recipe in its source website.

This app is developed thanks to the React Native course hosted by Stephen Grider on Udemy. The course can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/).
